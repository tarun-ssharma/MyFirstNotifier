A simple windows desktop notifier, meant to remind me to drink water.
Also, if there are any other tasks or motivational quotes I need to be reminded about, I can just write them up in 'Mot\*.txt' files, where \* is an integer, and this script will pick them up and remind me about them in regular intervals, along with a picture of Mario!
